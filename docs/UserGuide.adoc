== Introduction

PlanWithEase (PWE) is an application designed to help National University of Singapore (NUS) Information Security freshmen in creating a comprehensive degree plan according to the degree requirements.

PWE is optimized for those who prefer using a Command Line Interface (CLI). The commands used to interact with PWE
are designed to be simple and intuitive, so even those who are unfamiliar with CLI can use PWE with ease.

PWE also comes with a clean Graphical User Interface (GUI) that presents information in an organized manner.

Interested in using PWE to plan your degree easily? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `PWE.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for PlanWithEase.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Below are some example commands you can try:
* *`list`* : lists all modules
* **`add`**`name/Programming Methodology code/CS1010` : adds a module named `Programming Methodology` with code `CS1010` into module list
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd module shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the application

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user
.. e.g. in `add name/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter
which can be used as `add name/Programming Methodology`.
* Items in square brackets are optional parameters
** e.g. `name/NAME [tag/TAG]` can be used as:
.. `name/Database Systems tag/sql` (with optional `tag` parameter)
.. `name/Database Systems` (without optional `tag` parameter)
* Items with `…`​ after them are parameters that can be used multiple times (including zero times)
** e.g. `[tag/TAG]…` can be used as:
.. `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times)
.. `tag/programming` (i.e. 1 time)
.. `tag/programming tag/algorithms`, etc.  (i.e. many times)
** e.g. `[name/NAME NAME…]` can be used as:
.. `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times)
.. `name/Programming` (i.e. 1 time)
.. `name/Programming Methodology`, etc.  (i.e. many times)
* Prefixed-parameters can be arranged in any order after all non-prefixed parameters (if any)
** e.g. if the command specifies `INDEX name/NAME code/CODE`:
.. entering `INDEX code/CODE name/NAME` is also acceptable
.. entering `name/NAME INDEX code/CODE` is not acceptable
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a module: `add`

Adds a module to the module list. +
Format: `add code/CODE name/NAME credits/CREDITS [coreq/COREQUISITE]… [tag/TAG]…`

* `CODE` indicates the module code (e.g. `CS1010`).
* `NAME` indicates the name of the module (e.g. `Programming Methodology`).
* `CREDITS` indicates the modular credits assigned to the module (e.g. `004`).
* `COREQUISITE` indicates the module code that is a co-requisite of the module to be added.
* `TAG` indicates the extra information to associate the module with (e.g. `programming`, `loops`).

[WARNING]
====
`CODE`, `NAME`, `CREDITS`, and `TAG`/`COREQUISITE` (if specified) must not be empty. +
`CODE` should begin with two alphabets, followed by four digits, and may optionally end with an alphabet. +
`CODE` is case insensitive, and is treated as uppercase (e.g. `cs1010` is treated as `CS1010`), and should be unique. +
`NAME` should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces +
`CREDITS` should only contain whole numbers between 0 and 999 (both inclusive). +
`TAG` should only a single word containing alphanumeric characters. +
`COREQUISITE` follows the same format as `CODE`.
====

Example:

* `add code/CS1010 name/Programming Methodology credits/4 tag/programming tag/algorithms tag/c tag/imperative` +
Adds a module named `Programming Methodology` with module code `CS1010`, which is assigned `4` modular credits, to the module list. This module also has the tags `programming`, `algorithms`, `c`, `imperative`.

[TIP]
A module can have any number of tags (including 0)

Example: +

* `add code/CS1231 credits/4 name/Discrete Structures`

[WARNING]
====
When adding a module with a corequisite, if the module is added successfully, the co-requisite modules will be updated as well.
====

Example: +

* `add code/CS2113T name/Software Engineering and Object-Oriented Programming credits/4 coreq/CS2101` +
Adds a module named `Software Engineering and Object-Oriented Programming` with module code `CS2113T`, which is
assigned `4` modular credits and has module code `CS2101` as a corequisite, to the module list. This module also has
the tags `sweng`, `java`. +
Both `CS2113T` and `CS2101` will be updated to be co-requisites.

=== Listing all modules : `list`

Shows a list of all modules in the module list. +
Format: `list`

=== Editing a module : `edit`

Edits an existing module in the module list. +
Format: `edit INDEX [name/NAME] [code/CODE] [credits/CREDITS] [tag/TAG]… [coreq/COREQUISITE]…`

[NOTE]
====
* Edits the module at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number (beside the module code) shown in the displayed module list.
* You need to provide at least one of the optional fields to edit.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags/corequisites, the existing tags/corequisites of the module will be removed (i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.)
* You can remove all the module's tags by typing `tag/` without specifying any tags after it.
* Likewise, you can remove all module's co-requisites by typing `coreq/` without specifying any codes after it.
====

Examples:

* `edit 1 name/Data Structures and Algorithms code/CS2040C` +
Edits the name and code of the 1st module in the displayed module list to be `Data Structures and Algorithms` and `CS2040C` respectively. +
* `edit 2 code/CS2040C tag/` +
Edits the code of the 2nd module in the displayed module list to be `CS2040C` and clears all existing tags associated
 with the module. +
* `edit 3 coreq/CS1010` +
Edits the co-requisite of the 3rd module in the displayed module list to be `CS1010`. +
* `edit 4 coreq/CS2105 coreq/CS2106 coreq/CS2107` +
Edits the co-requisites of the 4rd module in the displayed module list to be `CS2105`, `CS2106` and `CS2107`. +

=== Locating modules either by name, code or credits: `find`

Finds modules whose names, code or credits matches any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find [name/NAME NAME…] [code/CODE CODE…] [credits/CREDITS CREDITS…]`

****

* The search is case insensitive. e.g `security` will match `Security`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Security Information` will match `Information Security`
* The order of the prefix does not matter. +
e.g. finding `name/NAME... code/CODE...` will have the same result as finding `code/CODE... name/NAME...`
* Only the module name, code or credits is searched.
* Only full words will be matched. e.g. `CS` will not match `CS1231`
* Modules matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). +
e.g. `Information` will return `Information Technology`, `Information Business`
****
Examples:

* `find name/Security` +
Returns `security` and `Information Security` in the displayed module list.
* `find name/Security Information Computer` +
Returns any module having names `Security`, `Information`, or `Computer` in the displayed module list.
* `find code/CS1231 CS2040` +
Returns any module having code `CS1231` or `CS2040` in the displayed module list.
* `find credits/004 012` +
Returns any module having credits `004` or `012` in the displayed module list.
* `find name/Programming code/CS1231` +

=== Deleting a module : `delete`

Deletes the specified module from the module list. +
Format: `delete INDEX`

[NOTE]
====
* Deletes the module at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed module list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, …
====

[WARNING]
====
* The deleted module will be removed from both the requirement category assigned and (where applicable).
* When deleting a module, any modules with the deleted module as its co-requisite will be updated
accordingly (i.e. deleted module is removed from the respective module's co-requisite list).
====

Examples:

* `list` +
`delete 2` +
