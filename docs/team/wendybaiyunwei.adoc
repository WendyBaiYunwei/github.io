== PROJECT: PlanWithEase

Hi! I am Yunwei, a student from the National University of Singapore (NUS). I love to build
applications that improve people's lives.

This portfolio documents my involvement in the PlanWithEase (PWE), a degree planner
application created by my team-mates, Ahn Taegyu, Ngo Wei Lin, Lee Yu Choy, Yeo Cheng Hong and me
 within one school semester. This portfolio shows what the project is about and my
 contribution to the project.

== Overview

For this project, we aim to simplify the process of degree-planning for NUS information security students.

As a developer, my role in the project was writing codes to enable users to:

* Add modules to the degree plan.
* Remove modules from the degree plan.
* Know the modules suggested to put inside the degree plan.

== Summary of contributions

|===
|_This section summarises my contribution to the project._
|===

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add/remove module codes to/from the degree plan*
** What it does: allows the user to add module codes to the degree plan, and remove the codes from the degree plan.
** Justification: This feature can be crucial because the degree plan is an important section that enables the users to plan well. Therefore, adding and removing the module codes are essential features that make PWE fulfill its purpose.
** Highlights: This enhancement aims to prevent possible errors, including the hidden ones that may occur when other parts of the software get modified. Besides, the model and logic implementation for the feature is kept as minimalistic as possible to reduce unnecessary coupling.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a command to suggest modules to put inside the degree plan.

* *Code contributed*: [{repoURL}/commits?author=WendyBaiyunwei[Commits]] [https://nuscs2113-ay1819s2.github.io/dashboard-beta/#search=WendyBaiyunwei[RepoSense Code Contribution Dashboard]]
